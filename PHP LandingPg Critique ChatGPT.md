<!-- Page: 1 -->

Below is a professional UX, brand, strategy, and competitive-positioning critique of your new wellness tech / AI platform landing page (https://t5q8mw2w4h.skywork.website/), evaluated specifically against the competitive set you provided:

Function Health
Superpower
SiPhox Health
InsideTracker
Mito Health

I’m evaluating your page as if I were:

1. A customer deciding whether to trust you with their biomarkers, money, and health journey

2. An investor assessing differentiation

3. A product/UX strategist evaluating clarity, conversion, and market readiness

## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY

Your landing page has strong early promise, with a modern aesthetic and a clear intention to blend biomarker testing + supplement personalization + AI.

BUT—compared to Function, Superpower, InsideTracker, and Mito—your page currently lacks:

✗ A clear value proposition in the first 5 seconds

✗ Differentiation from crowded competitors

✗ Specific user outcomes (“What will this platform actually do for me that others don’t?”)

✗ Clear visuals showing the product experience

✗ Social proof (critical in medical-adjacent DTC platforms)

✗ A unified narrative across supplement commerce + biomarker testing + AI coaching

Right now, the page reads more like an exploratory concept than a category leader.

## U DETAILED CRITIQUE BY SECTION

(These notes are extremely tactical, based on what converts in this category.)

## 1 — Hero Section (Top of Page)

What Competitors Do Well

- Function Health: A single, bold statement (“100+ biomarkers. Understand your health inside out.”) + strong credibility cues.

• Mito Health: Pure clarity — “Live longer, healthier. Optimize your biological age.”

Your Page Currently

<!-- Page: 2 -->

• The hero does not immediately state:

What the platform is

○ Who it is for

The transformation promised

## What You Need

Y A single sentence that instantly positions your angle.

Examples you could use:

“Your personalized longevity engine — biomarkers, AI coaching, and targeted supplements, all in one platform.”

“Finally, a wellness system that connects your biology to action — test, track, and optimize your healthspan.”

Also needed:

• A visual mockup of the dashboard

• A CTA that feels concrete (“Join early access”, “Take the free health assessment”, etc.)

## 2 — Messaging Hierarchy

Your story is not yet expressed as a sequence, whereas competitors follow a proven conversion formula:

1. Problem: You’re guessing about your health

2. Solution: We measure + interpret + guide

3. Proof: Clinical-grade testing, trusted experts

4. Outcome: Live longer, healthier

5. Offer: Start for $X

Your page currently jumps too quickly to “capabilities” without first setting up why the visitor should care.

## Fix

Add a simple, emotional section:

“You can’t optimize what you don’t measure.”

“We help you understand your biology — and then act on it.”

## 3 — Differentiation (Missing Today)

This is the biggest gap.

Consumers already know InsideTracker, SiPhox, and Function offer:

<!-- Page: 3 -->

• Biomarkers

• Long-lived dashboards

• Personalized recommendations

What is your differentiator?

Here are strong angles you could own:

## ✓ Differentiator 1 — Supplements + Biomarkers (Closed Loop)

None of the competitors seamlessly integrate supplement sales with biomarker-driven personalization the way YOUR supplement business could.

This is the biggest commercial moat you have.

## ✓ Differentiator 2 — AI + Coaching + Wearables

If you combine:

• Blood biomarkers

• Wearable data

• User logs

• AI-driven interpretations

...you could position yourself as the “Metabolic + Longevity Copilot.”

## ✓ Differentiator 3 — You actually sell consumables

Function, InsideTracker, and Mito do not monetize monthly consumables the way you can.

You can position recurring revenue as a feature:

“Your protocol adapts monthly based on your data.”

## Your Page Currently

None of this is stated.

You need a “Why we’re different” section.

## 4 — Visual Design & UI/UX

## What competitors show:

• Screenshots of real dashboard results

• Easy-to-understand visuals

• Images of test kits or biomarkers

## Your page:

• Good aesthetic direction

<!-- Page: 4 -->

• But lacks:

o Real UI

○ A test kit photo

○ A flow diagram (Test → Interpret → Improve)

○ Social proof

○ FDA/CLIA compliance badges (critical for trust)

Fix:

Add visuals such as:

• Dashboard mockup: Biological age, metabolic markers, sleep score

• Sample health plan: personalized supplements, meals, routines

- AI chat interface: “Your glucose variability improved by 12% this month. Here’s what drove it.” These images convert visitors significantly better.

## 5 — Trust & Validation

You are entering a category where trust is the currency.

Competitors showcase:

• Medical advisors

• Clinical references

• Partnerships with CLIA labs

• Customer testimonials

• Science tabs

You need to immediately establish credibility.

Your page currently:

✗ No medical advisory team

✗ No science language

✗ No lab partner naming

✗ No safety/compliance cues

Fix:

Add:

• "Built with scientists, dietitians, and longevity researchers."

<!-- Page: 5 -->

• "CLIA-certified labs. HIPAA compliant."

• "Peer-reviewed biomarker selection framework."

• Testimonials from early beta users

• Or clinical references for Avocatin B (huge differentiator)

## 6 — Narrative (Your Strength Is Unused!)

You have one of the most compelling narratives in the space:

• You created a patented bioactive (AvoB)

• You sell supplements

• You understand metabolic syndrome

• You have real research

• You are building a testing platform

• You can close the loop between biology → intervention → outcome

No competitor has this story.

Your page should clearly state:

“We are the only wellness platform built by metabolic researchers with patented, clinically-studied ingredients.”

This is a major asset you’re not leveraging.

## 7 — Competitive Positioning

Let's place you on the landscape:

| Company | Focus | Weakness | Your Opportunity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |


InsideTracker Nutrition algorithms Feels dated, not AI-native Go more modern, more AI, more personalized

Mito Health Biological age, strong No supplementation path Provide actionable interventions

<!-- Page: 6 -->

<!-- Weakness -->

Your strategy should be to occupy the space:

“The world’s first closed-loop longevity system — test, personalize, adapt.”

No one else owns that phrasing.

## Q SPECIFIC ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR PAGE

## MUST FIX (Highest impact)

1. Rewrite hero headline → clear outcome + product definition

2. Add dashboard mockups & sample recommendations

3. Add a 3-step flow (Test → Learn → Act)

4. Add differentiators vs competitors

5. Add trust markers (science, CLIA, advisors)

6. Clarify product offering:

☐ Is it a test kit?

A subscription?

○ A supplement plan?

○ An AI app?

Right now it's unclear.

## HIGH IMPACT (Next)

7. Add CTA: "Join Founders Circle," "Get early access," "Take the quiz"

8. Add use cases (Weight loss, metabolic health, healthy aging, performance)

9. Add testimonials (or “Voices from our research community”)

10. Show supplement integration directly in the platform UI visual

## BEST-IN-CLASS IDEAS FOR YOU

• “Your Longevity Score™” — based on your biomarkers + wearables

• “Adaptive supplement protocol” — updated monthly

• "AI Copilot for your biomarkers"

• “Metabolic Signature Testing powered by AvoB science”

• A 12-week onboarding program (Function and InsideTracker don’t have this!)
