## Objective

Refocus the landing page from DTC longevity messaging to a retailer-first Wellness OS narrative for VP Merchandising / retail executives in North America.

Primary conversion goal: drive qualified inbound for pilot + rollout conversations.

Primary economic hook: $9K/month gross revenue per retail door (pilot- validated).

## Priority 0 (Same day): Fix positioning mismatch above the fold

1. Replace hero headline + subhead

o Current: consumer longevity framing (quiz, membership)

o New headline options:

 “PHP‑Wellness 3.0: The Revenue‑Share Wellness OS for Retail”

 “A white‑labeled metabolic health profit center—paid only when it performs.”

o New subhead (deck-ready):

 “Launch in weeks. Monetize metabolic health through diagnostics →AI guidance →solutions →retesting—on a revenue‑share model with low operational lift.”

## 2. Replace primary CTAs

o Remove/secondary: “Take Health Quiz”, “Join Membership”, “Chat with ARIA”

o New primary CTAs:

 “Request a 5‑store pilot plan”

 “See per‑door economics”

 “Book a 90‑min kickoff”

3. Add a 3-bullet proof strip directly under hero

o $9K/month gross revenue per door (expected impact)

o Revenue‑share (risk‑reversed; aligned incentives)

o Turnkey pilot →chain rollout playbook (low store lift)

# Priority 1 (1–2 days): Rebuild page structure to match retail executive decision flow

A) Insert “Meijer-style Exec Summary” section (high on page)

Create a 4-box section with these headings: - Why This Matters - Outside-the- store engagement (loyalty + repeat purchase) - Category growth (vitamins/supplements tied to personalized plans) - New revenue streams (Rx pathway, testing, app/membership, supplement attach) - Nudges + education (simple, actionable, engaging) - Business Impact (Pilot-Validated Targets) - $9K/month gross revenue per door (expected) - App adoption target (e.g., downloads/opt-ins) - Category uplift target (vitamins/supplements) - Royalty/revenue-share mechanics (paid when it performs) - Customer Value - One dashboard for wellness signals (devices + tests) - Personalized recommendations linked to retailer inventory - Access to Rx pathway (where appropriate) - Retesting + progress proof - Recommended Next Steps 1. Form cross-functional pilot pod (Merchandising, Pharmacy, Digital/eCom, CRM/Loyalty, Finance) 2. 90-min kickoff: revenue model, compliance, pilot KPIs, timeline

B) Replace “Closed-Loop Longevity System” with “How it Works (Signals →Insight →Intervention →Proof)”

Use the storytelling outline language and keep it retailer-first: 1. Signals: 40+ devices + diagnostics + (optional) genetics 2. Insight: unified dashboard + AI decision engine (“we make the complex simple”) 3. Intervention: Rx pathway + nutrition + supplements (protocol-based) 4. Proof: retesting cadence + trend tracking + optimization loops

Add a one-line exec takeaway: - “PHP‑Wellness 3.0 connects devices + diagnostics + genetics into one AI-guided dashboard that orchestrates solutions and closes the loop with retesting—driving measurable outcomes and recurring revenue at retail scale.”

Priority 2 (2–4 days): Rewrite features into merchandising-first benefits + differentiation

A) Replace consumer feature blocks with a “Retail Feature →Benefit” map

Add a table or grid: - Revenue-share model →low-risk profit participation; aligned incentives - White-label branded experience →retailer owns customer + brand equity - Diagnostics + device signals + AI guidance →higher engagement →higher attach - Integrated solutions (Rx, nutrition, supplements) →multi-stream revenue per member - Closed-loop retesting

<!-- Page: 3 -->

cadence →continuity + repeat purchase engine - Loyalty/CRM/eCom integration →targeted offers + personalization at scale - Pilot →rollout playbook →faster time-to-value; less store chaos

B) Add a “Why we win vs point solutions” comparison

Create a simple comparison table: - Point solutions (testing-only, CGM-only, coaching-only) vs PHP (end-to-end program + monetization stack + continuity + retail execution)

Include the battlecard line: - “If it doesn’t plug into store economics and loyalty, it won’t scale.”

## Priority 3 (4–7 days): Replace proof + trust content with enterprise credibility

1. Remove consumer testimonials and “elite performers” section

o Replace with:

 Pilot governance overview

 Security/compliance posture (HIPAA/GDPR/CCPA, encryption, SOC 2)

 Operational trust metrics (uptime, enablement timeline)

2. Add “Operational Model (Low Lift)” section

o Stores are self-serve; corporate POC is the live interface

o Centralized support model

o Enablement timeline and rollout waves (pilot pod →district →chain)

3. Add “Pilot Scorecard (What we measure weekly)”

o Net-new members/week

o Opt-in →onboarding completion

o Diagnostics orders →completion

o Rx starts →fills

o Subscription conversion

o Supplement attach

o GM/door/month progress toward $9K/month

## Priority 4 (1–2 weeks): Conversion path + assets

1. Create 3 conversion offers (downloadable or form-gated)

o 1-page per-door economics sheet

o Pilot plan (5-store proof →100-store scale)

o Security/privacy one-pager

2. Add role-based routing on forms

o VP Merchandising / Category / Pharmacy / Digital / Loyalty

<!-- Page: 4 -->

## 3. Add FAQ for retail objections (4 must-haves)

o “Is this a distraction?”

o “Will stores execute?”

o “Why not Levels/Everlywell/SiPhox/ZOE?”

o “Privacy/compliance risk?”

## Copy blocks (ready to paste)

 Clear next steps: pilot pod + 90-min kickoff
