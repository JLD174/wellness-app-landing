Here are 6 best FAQ-ready reasons the PHP Wellness OS program works well for a new user (especially in the first 30 days):

## Consumer FAQ (User)

## 1. It’s fast and low-friction to start

 Users can complete onboarding without creating an account upfront, then verify contact via OTP later—reducing early drop-off and making “try it now” easy.

## 2. You get a personalized plan immediately (not generic content)

 The platform generates a Health Pilot report (scores across pillars + key metrics + priorities) and recommends a best-fit program using goals, age, sex, BMI, conditions, and support level—plus a clear “why this program” rationale.

## 3. Foundation-first: it fixes the basics before anything advanced

 Ingeni is designed so sleep, nutrition, movement, stress and gut foundations come first; Rx is optional and never the default, with clinical gating and safety education when applicable.

## 4. Daily guidance adapts to the user (so it stays doable)

 The system generates a personalized set of daily tasks that change based on progress and adherence, keeping the plan realistic and preventing overwhelm—rather than forcing a static program.

## 5. It keeps motivation high with rewards + milestones

 New users earn momentum through milestones, streaks, points, and rewards (tenant- configurable), with incentives tied directly to program completion and healthy actions— turning “good intentions” into repeat behavior.

6. Do you support GLP-1 programs too?”

 Yes. If GLP-1 support is right for you, we have them covered — and we wrap it in a foundation plan so results don’t depend on medication alone. Real-world data shows many people discontinue GLP-1 therapy within the first year, often due to tolerability, access, or cost barriers.

Ingeni helps improve the experience by pairing your branded GLP-1 pathway with step- by-step foundation coaching (nutrition, hydration, protein/fiber, sleep, movement) and side-effect support—especially for common GI issues like nausea, constipation, vomiting, and diarrhea—plus clear guidance on when to escalate to a clinician.

## 1. Why PHP Wellness OS vs building it ourselves?

1. Why PHP Wellness OS vs building it ourselves? PHP lets you launch a full wellness + prevention program fast—without the cost, time, and integration risk of building a health platform internally.

## 2. Can this be fully private-label under our brand?

2. Can this be fully private-label under our brand? Yes. The experience, programs, communications, and rewards can run under your brand so you strengthen loyalty and keep the customer relationship.

3. How does this drive measurable business impact (not just content engagement)? PHP is built around guided journeys, adherence, and outcomes—so you can track participation, completion, and repeat engagement that translate into retention and higher customer lifetime value.

## 4. How do you increase basket size and create new revenue streams?

4. How do you increase basket size and create new revenue streams? You can attach program-specific bundles (OTC/supplements), premium pathways, and subscriptions—creating recurring revenue while lifting frequency and average order value.

## 5. What data insights do we receive as programs scale?

5. What data insights do we receive as programs scale? We provide aggregated insights that map program participation to your SKUs, loyalty activity, and customer interactions—so you can see what journeys drive category lift, repeat purchase, and retention (without exposing individual-level health data).

6. How do you handle safety, security, HIPAA, and liability—especially for GLP-1/Rx? PHP separates wellness coaching from clinical decisions. If a customer qualifies for Rx support (e.g., GLP-1), they are routed through a prescriber-led workflow (screening, consent, education, documentation) so prescribing stays with licensed clinicians and defined protocols. The platform supports HIPAA-aligned safeguards (role-based access, auditability, secure handling of sensitive data) to help protect data and remove retailer liability.
