## Scope + what I reviewed

 Main page: https://preview–web-o3hljr.skywork.website/

 Linked pages in footer/nav that were accessible:

o /company (currently resolves to a Skywork login page)

o /blog (currently resolves to a Skywork login page)

## Executive summary (what’s working + what’s still off)

The hero and the new retailer-first framing are a big step forward (Revenue‑Share Wellness OS, $9K/door/month, exec summary, Signals→Insight→Intervention→Proof, pilot governance). The remaining misalignment is that several mid/lower-page sections still read like a DTC longevity membership (e.g., “Powerful Features for Your Wellness Journey,” “Trusted by Elite Performers,” “Your Journey to Better Wellness,” “Choose Your Wellness Journey,” consumer pricing/quiz CTAs). For a VP Merchandising / retail exec, those sections dilute credibility and create confusion about the business model.

## Page-by-page recommendations

1) Home (/) — align everything to retail buyer + pilot conversion

A) Navigation + CTAs

 Remove/replace “Take Health Quiz” in nav and as repeated CTA.

o Replace with “Request Pilot” or “Get Pilot Plan”.

 Keep two primary CTAs site-wide:

1. Request a 5‑store pilot plan

2. See per‑door economics

 Optional tertiary CTA (footer only): Contact / Security & Compliance

B) Sections to delete or fully rewrite (they currently pull you back into DTC)

1. “Powerful Features for Your Wellness Journey”

o Rewrite to “Retail Capabilities (What the retailer gets)”

2. “Trusted by Elite Performers”

o Replace with “Trusted by Retail Operators” proof types:

<!-- Page: 2 -->

 Pilot governance

 Security/compliance posture

 Implementation timeline

 Case study placeholders (even if anonymized)

## 3. “Meet ARIA, Your AI Health Assistant”

o Keep concept, reposition as Decision Engine not “assistant.”

o Rename section: “ARIA: The Decision Engine Behind the Dashboard”

o Replace consumer examples (“biological age decreased…”) with retail-safe outcomes:

 “Here are the 3 highest-impact actions for the next 7 days”

 “Protocol adherence and retest readiness”

 “Attach opportunities tied to retailer inventory”

## 4. “Your Journey to Better Wellness” + “Choose Your Wellness Journey” + “Join Membership”

o These are strongly DTC.

o Replace with:

 “Pilot →Rollout in 3 Phases” (Pilot pod →District → Chain)

 “Operating Model (Low Lift)” (you already started this)

 “Pilot Scorecard (Weekly) + QBR cadence”

## C) Strengthen the $9K/door/month claim (make it exec-safe)

Add a short “How we get to $9K/door/month” block directly under Exec Summary: - Show the revenue streams (no need for exact prices, but show mix): - Diagnostics / biomarker kits - Rx pathway (where appropriate) - App/membership - Supplement attach - Add a disclaimer line to keep it credible: - “Expected impact; validated in pilot; results vary by retailer readiness, loyalty activation, and pharmacy participation.”

## D) Add an explicit “Why we win vs point solutions” (keep it tight)

You have the header, but ensure the content lands the punch: - Point solutions sell tools to consumers. - PHP sells a profit-generating program to retailers. - If it doesn’t plug into store economics + loyalty, it won’t scale.

## E) Footer links must not route to Skywork login

 /company and /blog currently resolve to Skywork login. This breaks trust.

 Replace with real pages on your domain:

o /company →“Company” (team, mission, compliance, contact)

o /blog →“Insights” (retail wellness POV)

o /privacy →should remain

<!-- Page: 3 -->

## 2) Company (/company) — currently broken

## Issue

 The /company link resolves to a Skywork login page, not your company page.

## Fix

Create a real Company page with retailer credibility: - What we are: Retail Wellness OS (definition) - Who it’s for: VP Merchandising / Pharmacy / Digital / Loyalty - Why now: GLP‑1 era + metabolic health demand - Trust: security/compliance, clinical governance, data consent posture - Leadership: Darren Contardo + advisors (only what you’re comfortable publishing) - Contact: pilot request

## 3) Blog (/blog) — currently broken

## Issue

 /blog also resolves to Skywork login.

## Fix

Either: - Remove “Blog” from footer until ready, or - Launch a lightweight “Insights” page with 3–6 posts that support ABM: - “Retail wellness profit center: what VP Merchandising needs to see” - “Why point solutions don’t scale chain-wide” - “Closed-loop continuity: how retesting drives repeat purchase”

## Ultra-premium look: color + typography system

Your brand colors in Brain AI are #FF6633 (orange), #009966 (green), #FFFFFF (white). To feel ultra-premium in enterprise B2B, keep those as accents and introduce a dark neutral foundation.

Recommended premium palette (with Pantone approximations)

Core neutrals (premium foundation)

 Midnight / Charcoal (primary background / headers): #0B1220

o Pantone approx: Pantone 282 C (deep navy)

 Slate (secondary text): #475569

o Pantone approx: Pantone 431 C

 Off‑white (background): #F8FAFC

o Pantone approx: Pantone Cool Gray 1 C

<!-- Page: 4 -->

Brand accents (use sparingly)

 Orange accent (CTA / highlights): #FF6633

o Pantone approx: Pantone 1645 C

 Green accent (trust / success / metrics): #009966

o Pantone approx: Pantone 3405 C

## Usage rules (to keep it premium)

 70–80% neutrals, 15–25% off‑white surfaces, <5–8% accent.

 Orange for primary CTA only.

 Green for proof, KPI badges, “validated” labels.

Typography (premium enterprise)

Pick one of these pairings (all are modern, premium, and readable):

Option A (most “enterprise premium”)

 Headlines: Söhne / Söhne Breit (or fallback: Inter Tight)

 Body: Inter

Option B (high-end editorial + tech)

 Headlines: Neue Haas Grotesk (or fallback: Helvetica/Inter)

 Body: Inter

Option C (clean + distinctive)

 Headlines: Space Grotesk

 Body: Inter

## Type scale + styling

 H1: 52–64px, tight tracking (-1% to -2%), 1.05–1.15 line height

 H2: 32–40px, 1.15–1.25 line height

 Body: 16–18px, 1.5–1.65 line height

 Use sentence case headings (not title case) for modern premium feel.

## UI polish recommendations (premium cues)

 Replace busy gradients with subtle noise texture on dark backgrounds.

 Use one button style (solid) + one secondary (outline). Avoid multiple CTA styles.

 Add KPI “chips” (e.g., “$9K/door/month”, “Revenue‑share”, “Launch in weeks”) with consistent radius (10–12px) and subtle shadow.

 Increase whitespace between sections; reduce the number of sections by ~25–35%.

 Replace consumer imagery (happy users, elite performers) with:

o dashboard + retail workflow visuals

<!-- Page: 5 -->

o pilot scorecard mock

o unit economics snapshot

## SkyworkAI implementation checklist (what to change now)

1. Update nav: remove “Take Health Quiz”; add “Request Pilot.”

2. Delete/replace DTC sections: “Wellness Journey,” “Choose Your Wellness Journey,” consumer pricing.

3. Replace “Trusted by Elite Performers” with enterprise proof modules.

4. Fix footer links so /company and /blog do not route to Skywork login.

5. Apply palette + typography system consistently across all pages.

## Suggested page outline (final)

1. Hero (retailer-first + $9K/door/month + 2 CTAs)

2. Exec Summary (Why this matters / Business impact / Customer value / Next steps)

3. How it works (Signals →Insight →Intervention →Proof)

4. Per-door economics (revenue streams + pilot scorecard)

5. Why we win vs point solutions (comparison)

6. Operational model (low lift) + security/compliance

7. Pilot plan CTA (5-store pilot) + contact
